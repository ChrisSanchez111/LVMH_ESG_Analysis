LVMH ESG Ratings Analysis

This project evaluates the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE using ratings from Sustainalytics, S&P Global, and CDP.

Overview

The analysis includes:
- A written ESG comparison paper
- A cleanly formatted Excel file with rating data and built-in visualizations

 Key Insights

- Sustainalytics: Low ESG risk score of 13.9 → Normalized to 86.1
- S&P Global:  Strong disclosure score of 64/100
- **CDP:** Leadership scores — A for Climate & Forests, A− for Water → Normalized to 95, 95, and 90

LVMH demonstrates strong environmental ambition and social governance practices, but Scope 3 emissions remain a notable reporting gap.

Scoring Note

To make ratings comparable:
- **Sustainalytics**: `100 − Risk Score`
- **S&P Global**: Already on 0–100 scale
- **CDP Grades**: `A = 95`, `A− = 90`

These adjustments help visualize performance side-by-side across methodologies.
